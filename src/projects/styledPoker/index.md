This was my first attempt at making a tutorial to introduce some of the styling available for React. It shows how to used Styled Components and React Transition Group to build a UI for a poker game. I ultimately decided that the material here is too advanced to pair with an introductory lecture, so I made a [simpler](/projects/pokemon-team-builder) project instead. The material here may still be useful as a next step, though. It also shows off some what can be done with 3D animations powered by pure CSS.
