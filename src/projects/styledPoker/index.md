This was my first attempt at making a tutorial to introduce some of the styling available for React. It shows how to used Styled Components and React Transition Group to build a UI for a poker game. I ultimately decided that the material here is too advanced to pair with an introductory lecture, so I made a [simpler](/projects/pokemon-team-builder) project instead. Nonetheless, this project still does a good job of demonstrating how React can help make complex animations with relatively straightforward code. It also shows off some what can be done with CSS-powered 3D animations.
