I have a strong personal connection with this project. My motivations for working on it come from my time teaching logic courses at NYU, before I learned to code. I wanted a program that would help teach students how to build formal proofs. Programs like this already existed, but I found that their typical UI often lead to students being *more* confused and intimidated. Back then I knew the UI I wanted the program to have, and for my final project as a student at Flatiron School I finally got a chance to make it a reality.

For most students in intro to logic courses, the hardest challenge is building formal proofs. The challenge is twofold: the syntax involved in natural deduction proof rules can be intimidating and the strategy required for combining these rules in the right way can be initially unintuitive. Unfortunately, many students get hung up on the syntax, and so don't get a chance to develop an understanding of the strategy involved in proof construction.

Natural automatically handles details about proof syntax, so that students can focus on exploring proof-construction strategies. Instead of typing in the sentences themselves, students are given prompts and how they respond to these prompts determines how the proof gets filled in. To prevent decision paralysis, students are only presented with options that could feasibly be ways of continuing the proof. If a choice doesn't work out, students can easily go back and choose differently. In this way the application encourages play and experimentation as students attempt to complete their proofs.






## Functionality

### Current

### Future

Single column layout, embeddable and mobile friendly

Improved animations, issues with react reveal + redux, would try RTG or maybe React Spring

PWA setup

Broader set of logic games / apps


## Development
